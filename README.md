# Glassmorphism UI Library + Storybook

Lately, I've been fascinated with the front-end design modality known as "glassmorphism", which isn't necessarily a new thing but it's not something I've had an occasion to explore as much as I would like. This repo is an attempt to flesh out a component or UI library with that design modality in mind, largely with the purpose of learning the process to design frontends in this style.
